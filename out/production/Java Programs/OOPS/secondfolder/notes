* Packages: It is like the folder(Hierarchical Method).

* using import statement to access the function from the other package to the current file.

* what is meant by static variable:

when a member is declared as static it can be accessed before any of the object of the class has been created.
Static variable does not depend on object or without reference to an object.

with static variable we can run the program without creating the object of that class.

Static belongs to the class name and does not belong to the object.
